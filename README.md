## About The Project

OptionSettings is a simple feature that allows you to register your configuration/setting classes without having to add them to the Program / Startup file, keeping them clean and smooth.

Here's why this is good:
* Cleaner and readable Program / Startup files, keep them small.
* Make your configuration/setting classes ready-to-use just as you finish creating them, you don't even need to go into the Program / Startup file.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Install the package
   ```sh
   Install-Package AMillo.ConfigurationSettings
   ```
2. Call the AddConfigurationSettings() or AddConfigurationSettingsFromAssemblies() extension method from AMillo.InjectableServices directive in your Program.cs / Startup.cs file
   ```sh
    //Option 1
    builder.AddConfigurationSettings();
    //Option 2
    builder.AddConfigurationSettingsFromAssemblies(myAssemblies);
    //Option 3
    builder.Services.AddConfigurationSettings(myConfiguration);
    //Option 4
    builder.Services.AddConfigurationSettingsFromAssemblies(myAssemblies, myConfiguration);
   ```
## Usage
7
Now that you installed the package and set up the feature in your Program.cs / Startup.cs file, you can start creating your configuration/setting classes and registering them as follows:

1. Mark your configuraition/setting class with the <strong>[ConfigurationSetting("settingSectionName")]</strong> attribute
   ```sh
    [ConfigurationSettings("SampleConfiguration")]
    public sealed class SampleConfiguration
    {
        public string SettingOne { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public string SettingTwo { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    }
   ```
2. That's it! Your service will ge registered automatically on startup.

### Important

You need to specify the <strong>"sectionName"</strong> to the attribute's constructor, this value needs to match the section in your AppSettings file from where you want your configuration/setting class get configured. <br /><br/>
This is how the AppSettings.json file looks like for the previous example:
```sh
    {
      "SampleConfiguration": {
        "SettingOne": "valueOne",
        "SettingTwo": "valueTwo"
      }
    }
   ```
